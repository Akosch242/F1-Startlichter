# F1 start lights
F1 start lights in assembly for the Spartan-3E FPGA Karte, for an illustration on how this works [click here.](https://github.com/Akosch242/F1-Startlichter/blob/main/asm-digaramm.png)<br>
The hardest part was to create a random number without a clock or an already implemented function. I solved this with a counter that counts between 0 and 80 and when the starter button is pressed it stops.
